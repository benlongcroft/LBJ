{#                His feet hurt; he stepped and stopped and dragged and stopped,<br>#}
{#                young boy sat down, <br>#}
{#                hands buried within each other and looked up. <br>#}
{#                Mouth firm, indignant as children sometimes get,<br>#}
{#                eyes betraying him, as children can't help. <br>#}
{#                Scrawny boy, weathered pressed<br>#}
{#                his manner tended inwards, wrapped around a point half a metre from his chest,<br>#}
